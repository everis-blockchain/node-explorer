# Node Explorer

Stand alone desktop app for Win/Osx/Linux that allows connecting to a local or remote Corda node. Examine transactions, run flows and view node and network properties in a few simple clicks.


### Downloading the Node Explorer Binaries

If you're looking to download the node explorer and get started using it; download the latest packaged release on this repo's [releases](https://github.com/corda/node-explorer/releases) page.

There are install packages for Linux, OSX and Windows. 

To login to your Corda node, you will need to provide the:

- Hostname (domain, IP, or localhost)
- Rpc Port
- Username
- Password

Notes: You can find the Rpc port in your node config under `rpcSettings->address` or as displayed in a `CraSH shell` instance. If you have not explicitly set a username/password project defaults are `user1` and `test`.

Full instructions for using the Node-Explorer application at the [documentation](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.5/node-explorer.html)

### Setting up for Node Explorer for Development 

#### Note: This repository uses sub-modules. If cloning use `git clone --recursive` to automatically initialize and update the submodules.

#### Installation:
Requirements: NodeJS and Npm package manager.

1) ``git clone --recursive <this repo> <optional: target dir>``
2) ``cd node-explorer (or target directory)``
3) ``npm install``

Note this project uses the node-server submodule available at https://github.com/corda/node-server this must be initialised either by passing the `--recursive` option when running `git clone` OR executing the following commands.

1) ``git submodule init``
2) ``git submodule update``* 

*this command must also be run after any pull request which includes updates to the submodule. An alternative is to do pull requests with the following option:
``git pull --recurse-submodules``

**Other submodule commands:**

* Fetch and merge the latest node-server submodule code
  - ``git submodule update --remote``

* Doing work on the submodule i.e. changing files in ./server
  - submodules default to a detached head, so change to server directory and checkout a branch
  - ``cd ./server``
  - ``git checkout master``
  - Add or commit your changes as usual.

* To PULL submodule updates from server side, if there are changes on your local branch either merge or rebase with the pull
  - From MAIN project directory
  - `` git submodule update --remote --merge `` OR
  - ``git submodule update --remote --rebase``

* To PUSH submodule updates to server side
  - From MAIN project directory
  - ``git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand``

#### Running the Node Explorer w/o packaging

To test your changes or run the node explorer without packaging you must:

1 Build and run the server jar first
- `cd server`
- `./gradlew assemble`
- `java -jar ./server/build/libs/explorer-server-<version>.jar .`

2 Then run the front end from the main project directory
- `npm start`

3 The application can then be used through your browser at http://localhost:3000

#### Packaging electron installers / app files

Note: You must have a compiled server jar in the directory root 
 - `cd ./server && ./gradlew bootJar`, move compiled jar in `./server/build/libs` to the root.

Then run: ``npm run electron-pack``

### Deploy or Run Node Explorer with Docker

You can build docker images using the provided DockerFile(s). You will need to build two images, one for the Node Explorer front end ./DockerFile and another for the backend Node Server ./server/DockerFile (the Node Server DockerFile utilizes layers so you will need to extract the jar - see [A Better Dockerfile](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/))

If you DO NOT want to build your own images you can simply run Node Explorer using the docker-compose.yml and with contributed images. Follow the steps below:

#####1.  Set cordapps path

```
export CORDAPPS_PATH=Your cordapps path here
```

example

```
export CORDAPPS_PATH=/home/karthik/github/samples-java/Basic/yo-cordapp/build/nodes/PartyA/cordapps
```

```shell
export SERVER_URL=http://<host>:8580 #update this according to your configuration
```


#####2. Build docker-compose file

```shell
#docker-compose up -d
docker-compose build --build-arg SERVER_URL=$SERVER_URL
```

####2.1 Run docker-compose file

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

#####3. Browse to Node explorer UI

explorer runs at port 3000 # or according to the defined port in the docker-compose file

```
http://localhost:3000/
```


#####4. Set cordapps directory in settings

Provide cordapps path as **/cordapps** in settings tab.

```
/cordapps
```
